  title: 'Long Context, Less Focus: A Scaling Gap in LLMs Revealed through Privacy
    and Personalization'
  authors: Shangding Gu
  abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in privacy-critical
    and personalization-oriented scenarios, yet the role of context length in shaping
    privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness remains largely unexplored.
    We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how
    increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy
    protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with
    context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation
    questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks
    across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior.
    Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance
    degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We
    further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling,
    explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity
    Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general
    scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark
    to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and
    personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench

  title: Rethinking Diffusion Models with Symmetries through Canonicalization with
    Applications to Molecular Graph Generation
  authors: Cai Zhou, Zijie Chen, Zian Li, Jike Wang, Kaiyi Jiang, Pan Li, Rose Yu,
    Muhan Zhang, Stephen Bates, Tommi Jaakkola
  abstract: 'Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions
    invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy
    enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as
    equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition
    through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to
    an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained
    (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally
    recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at
    generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides
    a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness,
    universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant
    targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score
    complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow
    matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily
    with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate
    the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \times SE(3)$ symmetries.
    By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings,
    canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule
    generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel
    architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging
    GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.'

  title: 'Hunt Globally: Deep Research AI Agents for Drug Asset Scouting in Investing,
    Business Development, and Search & Evaluation'
  authors: Alisa Vinogradova, Vlad Vinogradov, Luba Greenwood, Ilya Yasny, Dmitry
    Kobyzev, Shoman Kasbekar, Kong Nguyen, Dmitrii Radkevich, Roman Doronin, Andrey
    Doronichev
  abstract: 'Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate
    outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English
    channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S.,
    with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of
    scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global
    drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment,
    failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk
    for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical
    competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today''s Deep Research
    AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous,
    multilingual sources without hallucinations. We propose a benchmarking methodology
    for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed
    at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness
    benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired
    with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect
    real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD,
    and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark
    queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions.
    We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity
    Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves
    79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research),
    46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets).
    Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that
    more compute yields better results.'

  title: Cold-Start Personalization via Training-Free Priors from Structured World
    Models
  authors: Avinandan Bose, Shuyue Stella Li, Faeze Brahman, Pang Wei Koh, Simon Shaolei
    Du, Yulia Tsvetkov, Maryam Fazel, Lin Xiao, Asli Celikyilmaz
  abstract: 'Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through
    interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge
    is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual
    users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With
    a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that
    matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings
    its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of
    preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question
    sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation
    into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference
    Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations
    offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference
    online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles,
    including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream
    solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical,
    social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated
    responses and users'' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer
    interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep
    changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with
    ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation
    is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.'

  title: Spectral Convolution on Orbifolds for Geometric Deep Learning
  authors: Tim Mangliers, Bernhard Mössner, Benjamin Himpel
  abstract: Geometric deep learning (GDL) deals with supervised learning on data domains
    that go beyond Euclidean structure, such as data with graph or manifold structure.
    Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to
    identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases
    can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such
    as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional
    neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept
    of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block
    for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory
    discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.

  title: On the Semantics of Primary Cause in Hybrid Dynamic Domains
  authors: Shakil M. Khan, Asim Mehmood, Sandra Zilles
  abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the
    study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of
    Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world
    where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid.
    Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked
    into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper
    we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework,
    namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in
    nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then
    be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test.
    We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our
    definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.

  title: 'ThermEval: A Structured Benchmark for Evaluation of Vision-Language Models
    on Thermal Imagery'
  authors: Ayush Shrivastava, Kirtan Gangani, Laksh Jain, Mayank Goel, Nipun Batra
  abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery,
    but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical
    role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance,
    search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery,
    thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring
    perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do
    not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately
    55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational
    primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates
    public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide
    dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse
    indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs,
    we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade
    under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses,
    with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results
    demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric
    assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal
    vision language modeling.

  title: 'PhyScensis: Physics-Augmented LLM Agents for Complex Physical Scene Arrangement'
  authors: Yian Wang, Han Yang, Minghao Guo, Xiaowen Qiu, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Wojciech
    Matusik, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan
  abstract: 'Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling
    up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused
    on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects
    (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating
    complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf
    organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing
    complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density
    and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting
    relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model
    both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we
    propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine,
    to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically,
    our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes
    assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics
    engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver
    informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework
    preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical
    parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic
    programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates
    stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
    prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering
    a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.'

  title: 'AnchorWeave: World-Consistent Video Generation with Retrieved Local Spatial
    Memories'
  authors: Zun Wang, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Jaemin Cho, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal
  abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central
    challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches
    often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor
    videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing
    a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment,
    as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed
    at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies
    accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and
    degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video
    generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple
    clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies.
    To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned
    with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through
    a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
    that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining
    strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the
    effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven
    retrieval.

  title: 'MAC-AMP: A Closed-Loop Multi-Agent Collaboration System for Multi-Objective
    Antimicrobial Peptide Design'
  authors: Gen Zhou, Sugitha Janarthanan, Lianghong Chen, Pingzhao Hu
  abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial
    peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight
    resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance
    AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals
    like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that
    make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language
    Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration
    based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in
    complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop
    multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system
    implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning
    framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design
    novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent
    system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective
    optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments
    show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing
    AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional
    results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural
    reliability.
